## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan. I write data-driven stories about sports and dig deeper into the underlying numbers behind why some athletes and teams perform better than others. I do all my analyses in R and strive to share as many of them as I can here on GitHub for the sake of clarity, reproducibility, and to help others learn how a lot of "fancy stats" are calculated. Here are a few of my favorite projects, which you can find the code for inside my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/danmorse314?tab=repositories).

### hockeyR
* An R package to scrape and store NHL play-by-play data
